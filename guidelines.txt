startproject is the command used in cmd to initiate the project
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ //localhost
 below i am disucssing the structure of django project:
 
 asgi ans wsgi are used for deployment
 manage.py is not supoose to be handled by us (ex: as it used to run our server)
 temper it only at high level
 python3 manage.py runserver/help etc
__init__.py used when django makes some new changes not usable at beginner level 
seeting.py is important
url.py is startinh point of the project and everything goes through here

django apps:

these apps can be called as part/components of our website
just like microservice
to create project:django-admin startproject projectname
to create app : python manage.py startapp appname
now we have to let our setting now about this new app
go to setting.py find installed apps and add new app there 


{ % url 'password' %} means url website pr kuch aur ho sakta hai but uska varibale name password hai (use % in case of logic for loop etc)

{{ variable name }} ( use {{ basically for puling out values) 


Suppose i am creating different apps for the same project then i have to add them under installed apps in setting.py under project  

# various fields for models can be refrenced from django documentation

# anyttime we make changes in models.py those changes need to be migrated to the databse(called migration)
comand:  python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py makemigrations (will let us know the models changes)	

#pillow is the pythin images lib .. which needs to be installed to enable images usage.

# 001_intial.py is created under migrations and see the changes under operations there
# another migration will create 002 etc etc

#python manage.py createsuperuser   (now enter user name and password) we can create multiple users
# python manage.py changepassword

inside admin.py we need to show what models we need to be in admin.py
